# Samurai-Story
You wield the magical samurai sword that has been passed down in your family for generations, but you’re unsure how to use it as it is also a family tradition for the wielder to discover their limits themselves. Unfortunately, you are also assigned personal bodyguard for the emperor of Japan before you are able to even discover the slightest magical ability of the sword (so far, it just looks like an old metal sword). Even worse, you hear rumours on the streets that there is an assassination plan schemed against the emperor. Unknowing who, what, where, when, and how, it is up to you to figure out who’s behind this and save the emperor’s life - after all, not being able to protect the emperor leads to your shameful seppuku. With your trusty (or rusty) magical samurai sword, you must dive undercover into the dark, underground society and use your wits to figure out who can be trusted - or is it that simple?
